# MC Proxy Manager

~~This is draft plugin for our private mini-network of Minecraft servers and a few proxies.~~
Currently, this is not happening and likely whole idea is dead. :(

At this moment, this plugin doesn't do anything awesome that other plugins do and we didn't decided yet about quite
important parts of our technology stack.  
Thus this plugin could be abandoned in favor of other plugin (or their mix) and/or due to change of proxy software (
likely Velocity in that case).  
This plugin is not for BFU (basic franta user / brain free user).  
PR/Issues still welcomed, but rejected if they will take too much different direction from my (our) /needs.
